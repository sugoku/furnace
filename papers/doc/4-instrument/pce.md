# NEC PC Engine instrument editor

PCE instrument editor consists of only three macros, almost like TIA:

- [Volume] - volume sequence
- [Arpeggio] - pitch sequence
- [Waveform] - spicifies wavetables sequence

It also has wavetable synthesizer support, but unfortunately, it clicks a lot when in use on the HuC6280.
